# Blazor.FormBuilder
 A dynamic form builder Blazor UI component with validation support.
 
 Instead of creating a static EditForm with manual binding, this library uses reflection to dynamically build a form for a givem model class.
 It supports all of the common componentmodel annotations for data valiation.
 
 There is a hard dependency on MatBlazor (https://www.matblazor.com/), but I am working to allow you to map your own UI component library.
